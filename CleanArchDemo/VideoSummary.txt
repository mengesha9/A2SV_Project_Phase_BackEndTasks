The videos demonstrate the implementation of the clean architecture with .NET by building a leave management system.
This practical example helps to illustrate how the clean architecture principles are applied in a real-world scenario.
The key concepts presented in the videos include:

Domain Layer: In the context of the leave management system, 
the domain layer defines the core entities and logic related to leaves. 
It might encompass concepts like LeaveRequest, Employee, and LeaveType.
The domain layer remains independent and isolated from external dependencies.

Application Layer: The application layer handles the use cases specific to the leave management system. 
It defines interfaces for operations like submitting leave requests, approving or rejecting requests, 
and calculating leave balances. This layer also includes DTOs for transferring data between different parts of the system.

Infrastructure Layer: The infrastructure layer is responsible for implementing the interfaces from the application layer.
 For instance, it might involve connecting to a database to store leave requests and employee information. 
 Different projects within this layer could employ various technologies, such as Entity Framework for database access.

Presentation (API) Layer: The presentation layer deals with user interaction.
For the leave management system, it encompasses the API endpoints that allow employees to submit leave requests,
 managers to approve or reject requests, and users to view leave balances.
 This layer communicates with the application layer to execute the relevant use cases.

By building a leave management system with .NET using the clean architecture,
 the videos showcase the practical application of the clean architecture principles.
They demonstrate how to organize the codebase into distinct layers, establish clear boundaries,
and ensure that changes in one part of the system do not adversely affect other parts.
This approach enhances code quality, maintainability, and adaptability,
 making it easier to evolve the system over time while minimizing the risk of unintended side effects.
